# What is the AWS CDK Landing Zone?

Launch faster on AWS and become fully compliant from day one! Our solution is designed for B2B startups and growing businesses that want to focus on building and deploying their products on AWS instead of managing multi-account complexity.

## The Hidden Cost of AWS Simplicity

While AWS makes it super easy to get started, that initial simplicity can lead to significant challenges:

- **Limited isolation and increased blast radius**: Without proper account separation, errors in one workload can affect all others
- **Scalability issues**: Single-account approaches don't scale well with organizational growth
- **Complex cost management**: Tracking costs becomes increasingly difficult as resources multiply
- **Security and compliance challenges**: Implementing distinct security policies becomes complex
- **IAM configuration complexity**: Managing access control requires intricate policies, increasing security risks

## Our Solution

The AWS CDK Landing Zone from Towards the Cloud delivers:

### 1. Full Compliance Out of the Box
- **100%** score on CIS AWS Foundation Benchmark
- **96%** rating on AWS foundational security best practices

### 2. Secure Guardrails
- Pre-configured security policies based on AWS's best practices
- Automatic blocking of risky actions
- Protection for both business and budget

### 3. Everything via Infrastructure as Code
- Written completely in AWS CDK Typescript
- Utilizes GitHub actions to quickly deploy on AWS

### 4. Batteries included
- Uses CloudFormation stacksets to automatically provision the AWS accounts in the organization
- Multi-region is supported for the stacksets
- Adds observability tools including notifications to keep you in control
- Bootstraps your AWS workload accounts so you can immediately start developing on it.

# Features

Our solution goes beyond basic AWS Control Tower or AWS OrgFormation implementations. It provides the right security, observability and bootstraps to make sure youâ€™re ready to instantly onboard your applications and products.

To see how, hereâ€™s a list of the features that are **already included** in our Landing Zone:

| **Increase Service Quota**      | Automates requests for AWS service quota increases via a custom resource, ensuring resources are available as demand grows.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Encrypted SNS Topic**         | Creates an SNS topic with encryption backed by a KMS key and tailored access policies to secure notification data and control subscriber access.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Detect StackSet Drift**       | Regularly checks for drift in CloudFormation StackSets using a scheduled Lambda function, maintaining the desired configuration state across your account.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Delete Default VPC**          | Removes the default VPC in newly created regions using a custom resource and Lambda, helping maintain a clean and secure AWS environment by eliminating unused resources.                                                                                                                        |
| **Set Alternate Contact**       | Automatically configures alternate contacts (security, billing, operations) for new AWS accounts, ensuring that proper notifications and account management are in place.                                                                                                                        |
| **Unsubscribe Marketing Mails** | Automatically opts out new AWS accounts from receiving AWS marketing emails, helping maintain desired email preferences across the organization.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Set Account Password Policy** | Enforces a robust IAM password policy with requirements like minimum length, expiration, reuse prevention, and complexity rules, thereby strengthening overall account security.                                                                                                                 |
| **CDK Bootstrap Stackset**      | Provisions the core bootstrap resources needed for CDK deployments. This includes an encrypted and versioned S3 bucket for file assets, an ECR repository for container images with automated image scanning and lifecycle rules, and preconfigured IAM roles.                                   |
| **Central Alerts Stackset**     | Establishes centralized, encrypted SNS topics for alerting. It sets up topics for CloudTrail and AWS Config notifications, applying organization-based access controls and allowing the security team to receive timely alerts via email.                                                        |
| **AWS Config Stackset**         | Deploys AWS Config recording with integration to existing log archive and security accounts. It imports an SNS topic for notifications as well as an S3 bucket for storing AWS Config logs, ensuring that configuration changes and compliance events are centrally recorded and alerted upon.   |
| **Secure Defaults**             | Applies security best practices by enforcing secure defaults. For global accounts, it blocks public S3 access and sets a strict account password policy; for regional deployments, it removes the default VPC, enables EBS encryption by default, and secures new VPCs' default security groups. |
| **Security Hub Management**     | Centralizes AWS Security Hub configuration across the organization by deploying aggregators, establishing organization-wide configuration policies for enabled and disabled standards, and associating these policies with the relevant organizational units.                                    |
| **Log Archive**                 | Sets up a centralized logging architecture for both CloudTrail and AWS Config. This stackset provisions secure S3 buckets with access logs, lifecycle rules, and proper bucket policies to ensure compliance and effective log retention across the organization.                                |
| **GuardDuty Deployment**        | Deploys Amazon GuardDuty with dual options: either enabling a delegated administrator account for centralized management or auto-configuring GuardDuty detectors along with organizational settings to automatically enable GuardDuty for all members.                                           |
